If you're having connection problems, here's some things to try.

If the other node is not showing up:
  Turn on Comms.broadcast.tcp.localscan.enabled on both nodes, wait for a rebroadcast.  Whether it works, I recommend disabling it afterwards - it opens 256 connections per 192.168.* address your computer has, on every rebroadcast.
  Double check that the advertisement ports haven't been changed
  Check the logs for deserialization errors
  Double check they're on the same network; try pinging the other computer
  On one computer (the one with visible ports / less firewall, if possible), open Comms and find a good local address and port
    (The local node is usually the one with all green comms)
    usually 192.168.1.X:Y
    On the other computer, Windows > Manual connect... ; enter X:Y
    Hopefully that gets them to connect.
    At some point I may add the ability for them both to cooperate in overcoming firewalls on both sides, but haven't yet.
  Windows > QR channel... on both computers, and point their webcams at each others' screens, to exchange Ads and either connect via other means, or transfer the data directly over QR.  (Warning, it's like 1 KB/s.)
  Check the logs for a crashed Process

If the other node IS showing up, but isn't actually connecting:
  Check the Comms window - if any of the lines are grey, it COULD be stuck waiting for a connection to timeout.  Wait for 30-60 seconds.
  Double check both nodes have the same:
    encryption
    encryption protocol
    version (check the logs for deserialization errors and stuff)
  Check the logs for a crashed Process
