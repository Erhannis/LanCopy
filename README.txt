It's 2021.  It is a mockery of my profession, that I have to do more than wave my hand, to copy text from one computer to another sitting next to it.  As such is somewhat beyond the realm of reasonability, at the moment, I have created the next best thing: LanCopy.

If you open this program on any number of computers that are on the same network, then *assuming nothing stupid goes wrong* (and that is a large assumption, when dealing with networks...or computers), they should automatically discover each other and begin broadcasting the contents of the clipboard.  Double click an entry to copy that node's clipboard to your own.

Currently only works with text, but I may get file drag-and-drop working by the end of the night.

Please note the obvious security hole: it continually broadcasts your clipboard, in unencrypted plain text.  Be careful not to copy passwords while LanCopy is open, unless you're feeling *exceptionally* devil-may-care.

I release this program under the MIT license.  May it help patch the gaping hole that has inexcusably plagued us since the dawn of computing.
