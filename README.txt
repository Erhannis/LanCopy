It's 2021.  It is a mockery of my profession, that I have to do more than wave my hand, to copy text from one computer to another sitting next to it.  As such is somewhat beyond the realm of reasonability, at the moment, I have created the next best thing: LanCopy.

If you open this program on any number of computers that are on the same network, then *assuming nothing stupid goes wrong* (and that is a large assumption, when dealing with networks...or computers), they should automatically discover each other and begin broadcasting whatever you've told LanCopy to post - the clipboard, or files, atm.  Double click an entry to copy that node's clipboard to your own, or download the posted files.

Please note the obvious security hole: it broadcasts your clipboard, or files, in unencrypted plain text.  There's even a setting to *continually* broadcast your the contents of your clipboard.  Be careful not to copy passwords while LanCopy is open (and `loop clipboard` is on), unless you're feeling *exceptionally* devil-may-care.

I release this program under the MIT license.  May it help patch the gaping hole that has inexcusably plagued us since the dawn of computing.
